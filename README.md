# San Diego Top Spots
project for web 102

There are some great places to see in San Diego. This project will take a provided JSON file and turn it into a table in HTML with links to Google Maps using jQuery.

First I cloned the project from the SDCS github site and made a local directory to which I built from. I created an HTML and JS file and ran the site static.

All unit tests passed and the project was a success.
